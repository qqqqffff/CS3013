Notes: 
- my SJF algorithm does sort the jobs but does not sort exactly as the test specifies since the test also sorts
jobs with the same job length which my algorithm does not
- my program is ran with 3 possible configurations 0: only display the job execution, 1: only show the analysis,
2: show both. 0 = EXECUTION, 1 = ANALYSIS, 2 = BOTH and all are set by the scheduler_mode variable in the main function
