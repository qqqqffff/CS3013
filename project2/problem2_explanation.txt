Scenario 2:

1) While the plane is at the terminal (maximum of 6 slots at the terminal) the thread sleeps
for a randomized amount of time
2) Before takeoff the plane taxis to the intended takeoff location taking a random amount of
time. If all the takeoff paths are taken then the plane will enter a waiting queue with priority
given to the takeoff planes and then to the landing planes
3) While taking off the plane sleeps a random amount of time to simulate the takeoff speed and updates
positions and notifies the planes that are waiting in queue
4) The plane will fly around for a random amount of time before attempting to landing
5) The plane will attempt to land but if no spots are available they will enter a landing queue
6) Landing speed is randomized to simulate the time it takes to land and then the smiulation will exit and
planes return to the airport to be taxied and unboarded both in randomized amounts of time.
