NOTES:

Scenario 1:
- Number of sports matches are not infinite and is set using the variable "max_number_o_matches" (currently set to 4)
- Athlete Dialogs are buggy due to scheduler issues (sometimes they don't say the right thing)
- While there is a sport active announcements are muted i.e. athlete generation announcements

Scenario 2:
-A bug prevents the maximum amount of small planes being reached (maximum amount of small planes reached is 23)
-A context switch bug also sets the values of some of the take off and landing numbers path numbers to 0 but does not affect
preformance (array occupation values are correctly set and process)
-Time interval between plane generation is 0.5 seconds
