Scenario 1:

1) For my program players are randomly created and generated by threads with 36 total possible threads for baseball players
44 total possible threads for soccer players and 44 total possible threads for football players
2) Maximum and minimum team parameters are defined in the program with maximum team sizes being 18 22 and 1 for baseball
football and soccer respectively.
3) While a specified sport is playing any nonparticipants wait until their ID is signaled by the sport simulation threads
4) If ready soccer players are generated during the time that it takes to complete a match they will be automatically placed
into queue for the next match that will be run directly after the previous soccer match
5) the previous sports are stored in a revolving array that prevents a single sport from not being played
6) football quarter times are randomly generated from 1 to 5 seconds and baseball inning times are also randomly generated from
1 to 5 seconds and soccer match times are randomly generated from 6 to 10 seconds
7) Once a game simulation is possible the player threads are immediately woken and resume play on the field for their designated sport
